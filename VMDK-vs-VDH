File Formats:

OVF: ( Open Virtualization Format )
  - An OVF is usually made up of several files.
OVA: ( Open Virtualization Appliance )
  - An OVA is a single file that consists of a TAR archive of all of the above OVF files (for VMware this is usally the .ovf and .vmdk files).

Both the OVF and OVA formats typically comprise of four files;

The descriptor file (.ovf) – An  XML file which describes the packaged virtual machine. The file also has metadata included such as the name, hardware requirements, references to the other files in the package and descriptions.
Virtual Machine Disk Files (.vmdk) – VMware products utilise a variant of the VMDK format that is designed for distribution and compressed.
A Manifest File (.mf) – Used for integrity and contains the SHA1 digest of all files in the package (except for the .mf). This file is optional and not required.
A Certificate File (.cert) – You may also have a .cert file with the .mf file for authenticity to allow the package author to be verified. This file is optional and not required.
